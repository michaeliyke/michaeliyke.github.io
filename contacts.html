 <!-- <h2>Now A Full Web designer/developer</h2>  -->

<p class="text">
<!--
	My emergence as a UX designer since June 2014 is a thrill. It was a big surprise to many people. But I took courage and before long, I started writing my own code.
I started off by learning some HTML and CSS after participating in a workshop organised by the VBM group, a small group that organized workshops accross  Nigeria to educate the
 youths on the use of computer skills. With very less coaching, I was bound to have questions. Why wont I? Ready to explore and put my new skills to work but there was nobody to answer a
 few &quoe;whys&quote;. But I am glad I got over it. Some friends helped me in a very great way. 


	My dream is to soar high like an eagle in the field of programming.
	--> 
After my first training and workshop when I started off as a web designer, I made a lot of progress. I have worked hard through the entire time till present. Now, I am happy to say that I am fully a web designer and developer. 
As I progressed, I learned more HTML and CSS, then Javascript and jQuery making for a full fledged dynamic design. I have also learned some PHP, MySQL, Python and Ruby. As a growth oriented developer, I am also on a schedule of progressive learning for advancement in my career.
I want to learn more PHP, MySQL and some advanced Javascript like Angular Javascript and JSON.  My goal is to be able compete with the world's best developers. My new application made in pure Javascript will be launched on this site very soon and I will update this page accordingly. I believe in working very hard to account for any job I take. For now, I am available for any form of a web developer's job. I accept projects from clients ranging from personal to company-size websites or related projects. What I do for clients sorely depends on their requirements.To contact me,  send me a mail <a title="click to send a mail" hreflang="en-US" href="mailto:me@michaeliyke.info"> here.</a>

	<h2>My dream and passion for web technology</h2> 

		<p class="text">
			I have long dreamt of a career in computer programming. Meanwhle, for a very long time, I have wondered of the thrilling maggics a computer can do. So far, I had concluded that such wonders could have been masterminded by a mere brain-making of a human being. However, my final position remained that I must get to the root of whatever behind this maggic. Gradually, I discovered that those brains are actully the handiwork of human fingers, fingers like mine. <br/>
			All my life from infancy, I have wanted to live a life that simulates power. I like to take a challenge, a real world challenge. Up until I descovered the awesome world of web programming, I had kept searching for a way to impact my environment and the world.Presently, I have a focus on programming real good applications that solve live problems while I keep my experience alive as a UX designer. I am glad to be part of the web.

<h2>My level of learning and what I can do</h2> 

<p class="text">
   Basically, have learned web design at different tutorials. I have also leaned at some practical based centers where I practiced design from syntax mastering to gorgeous templates creation. The use of color, graphics and videos in both small and vast developement environments. I am presently holding learning in a number of advanced tools to improve my design skills. Web languages I can conviniently work with include HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT &amp; the jQuery library. I can work conviniently with a Content Management System such as Wordpress. As a good content manager, I can afford to be introduced to a system of management that is enteirly a new technology, I learn quickly.

<h2>My dream company</h2> 

<p class="text">
	Everybody likes a company that supports growth. I am not an exception. I will fully and dedicatedly work with a company that has an interest for growth, promotes incremental knowledge of skills and follows a track of change through an expectancy grid. The web industry has only just begun  but what is good is the speed of growth. We all can witness how the entire web technology meandered in our eyes. Only a few years ago, the web experience was a mess. Today, it is a well known testimony that the internet at least, knows how we think and can rightly predict what we want. Now we don't have to type all the words in a phrase we want to search in the popular google search related search engines before we see results.

Now it has sinchronized the entire system of design. I like a track of change in this nature which expects, inspects and evaluates usng a measure of .
